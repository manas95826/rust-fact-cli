# Security Policy

## üîí Security Considerations

This project handles sensitive data and external API communications. Please follow these security guidelines:

### **Environment Variables**
- **Never commit** `.env` files containing real credentials
- **Use `.env.example`** as a template for required environment variables
- **Keep your bot token and chat ID secure** - they provide access to your Telegram account

### **API Security**
- The tool makes HTTP requests to external APIs
- **Rate limiting** is implemented to prevent API abuse
- **Timeout handling** prevents hanging requests
- **Error handling** ensures graceful failure without exposing sensitive data

### **Telegram Bot Security**
- **Bot tokens** provide full access to your bot - keep them secret
- **Chat IDs** are personal identifiers - don't share them publicly
- **Bot permissions** should be limited to necessary functions only
